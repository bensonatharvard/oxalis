# Oxalis Tetraphylla
Visual Essay on Oxalis Tetraphylla

## Iron Cross Not Four Leaf Clover
Exceptionally rewarding, Oxalis tetraphylla "iron Cross" is a bulbous perennial forming a lush mound of rich green leaves composed of 4 heart-shaped leaflets, each with a dark purplish blotch at its base. THe burgundy marking across the center of the leaves is reminiscent of a cross. During the day the leaves open out to receive sunlight but at night they retract and fold up like small umbrellas, adding interest to the plant. From early summer until frost, the handsome foliage is topped by sprays of trumpet-shaped, bright pink flowers. Easy to grow and not invasive, this Good Luck Plant makes a colorful addition to rock gardens and offers a long season of interest when grown in containers. -- excerpt from gardenia.net
