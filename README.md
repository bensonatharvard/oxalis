# Visual Essay on Oxalis Tetraphylla


Oxalis tetraphylla is a bulbous perennial wood sorrel native to Mexico. It is commonly referred to as an iron cross, or jocoyol(in spanish).

It is recognized by its four green heart-shaped leaves containing a purple heart. The purple variations can appear as either band, a filled center, or even reversed from the outside inwards.

Between late spring and summer, the oxalis will bloom a pinkish reddish 5 petal flower, known as an ionoxalis scopulorum rose.

The oxalis is often mistaken for a clover, which has a distinct rounded leaf instead of heart-shaped.

This sheet was collected by Cyrus Guernsey Pringle, born in East Charlotte, Vermont. He was a quaker and an adamant pacifist. So much so that even facing the threat of death, he refused to perform military duty in the Civil War. He was personally pardoned by President Lincoln and went on to start his own herbarium Pringle Herbarium. He crossbred three famous types of potatoes the “ruby,” the “snowflake,” and the “alpha.” In 1885, he set out on his botanical conquest of Mexico, where he spent the next 26 years collecting over 100 new varieties, 29 new genera,  and 1,200 new species, including this Oxalis tetraphylla Cav.

C.G. Pringle collected this sample in the state of <span data-click-image-zoomto="57,3725,1136,1141">Morelos, Mexico, on September 11, 1900.</span> It is about 30cm tall and 15cm wide. The sample shows faint marks of the purple heart strip. The <span data-click-image-zoomto="240,2801,1137,1141">bulb collected</span> in this sample has 19 stems shooting off it. The leaves and flowers appear to be <span data-click-image-zoomto="460,1640,658,661">pressed downwards</span>, similar to how the plant would occur at night, as the oxalis responds to the onset of darkness with a circadian rhythmic nastic movement.

The badianus manuscript represents the <span data-click-image-zoomto="1,1,173,174">oxalis tetraphylla</span> without its purple heart. The stems transition from bright red to four green leaves shaped more strongly like a rounded cross. Also, the <span data-click-image-zoomto="30,251,173,173">bulb is rounded with roots sprouting from the base</span>. The Aztec medicinal use in the badianus manuscript is to “bring forth dried-up saliva” to quench thirst. Specifically, it instructs “one who lacks saliva and is inordinately thirsty should swallow some of the liquid, and some should only hold it in their mouth. The oxalis is edible and has a very acidic taste.

Our herbarium sheet represents the oxalis tetraphylla by additionally re-interpreting and illustrating the life that surrounds the oxalis. The plant existing constantly fending off on three fronts--- wildlife, people, and industry. 
<param ve-image url="https://github.com/bensonatharvard/oxalis/blob/main/oxalis_herbarium_sheet.jpg?raw=true">


A combination of the bulb and the high oxalic acid content of the plant help fend off <span data-click-image-zoomto="2602,4079,789,792">wildlife</span> quite well. Grazing animals like cows will eat the leaves and stems, but the bulb is safely tucked below, ready to sprout again. In addition, the oxalic acid’s acidic taste and ability to cause kidney stones deters animals from feeding it on it. However, the oxalis must be wary of the <span data-click-image-zoomto="329,1160,1363,1369">gopher</span> as it will dig into the ground to find the <span data-click-image-zoomto="730,1760,1364,1369">corm</span> to eat. The bulb is starchy and rich in oxalic acid. 
<param ve-image url="https://github.com/bensonatharvard/oxalis/blob/main/oxalis_herbarium_sheet.jpg?raw=true">

The oxalis is considered an undesired and invasive weed by many; therefore, people are constantly trying to <span data-click-image-zoomto="2075,4102,658,660">eliminate it</span>. Since it is a bulb, trying to pull out the oxalis becomes a fruitless effort, as the stems will come off, but the bulb will stay protected in the soil. Being branded as a weed led many to use <span data-click-image-zoomto="2028,1811,789,792">garlon</span> as a pesticide for oxalis, but garlon has dubious efficacy and is classified as a tier 1 herbacide, especially dangerous to children who often eat oxalis, a sour treat. Despite being undesired, the oxalis actually provides a lot as a ground cover. It goes dormant in the winter months but keeps the soil together, and the withered leaves and stems enrich the ground with <span data-click-image-zoomto="630,2061,658,660">phosphorus.</span>
<param ve-image url="https://github.com/bensonatharvard/oxalis/blob/main/oxalis_herbarium_sheet.jpg?raw=true">

The third frontier for the oxalis is against the <span data-click-image-zoomto="2189,1192,1096,1100">industry</span>. The soil is often poisoned with sewage sludge or run-off from zinc and lead smelters. Fortunately, oxalic acid serves as a chelating agent and is both within the oxalis and excreted by the roots. Oxalic acid can capture a plethora of <span data-click-image-zoomto="378,4084,761,765">heavy metals</span>, including <span data-click-image-zoomto="2282,2944,913,917">zinc, cadmium, and lead.</span> This property brought into the modern context allows the oxalis to be an excellent <span data-click-image-zoomto="1134,2372,1315,1320">soil remediator</span> for heavy metals. As a soil remediator, the oxalis acid is also able to bind to <span data-click-image-zoomto="938,4011,761,765">calcium.</span> While this typically causes kidney stones in organisms, in calcified soil, it remediates the soil while storing calcium in the bulb for future use. With <span data-click-image-zoomto="835,2436,914,917">calcium oxalate</span> stored in the bulb, the oxalis can go dormant in the winter or resprout easily when eaten.

The leaves are drawn in both open and closed as <span data-click-image-zoomto="804,657,1363,1369">nyctinasty</span> occurs in oxalis wood sorrels. During nighttime or low lighting, the leaves turn downwards. By turning the leaves downwards, the plant can retain temperature and remove surface water from the foliage. It also directly discourages nighttime herbivory. The circadian rhythmic nastic movement also prevents disruption of photoperiodism by moonlight. Along with the leaves, the flowers also share this same movement. Oxalis also uses nyctinasty to overcome photoinhibition, a decrease in efficiency of photosynthesis when exposed to an overabundance of light.

The high <span data-click-image-zoomto="1345,3859,1018,1102">oxalic acid</span> content is a distinct feature of the oxalis. Oxalic acid has been suggested to before formed in the plant during photorespiration, oxidizing the glycolate/glyoxylate. Oxalic acid is able to react with cations creating different types of oxalates. In industry, it is widely used as a bleaching and restoration of wood. The oxalate may make up 3-10% of the entire plant mass. The presence of oxalic acids contributes directly to the way oxalis reacts to forces around.
